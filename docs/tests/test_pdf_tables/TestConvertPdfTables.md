# TestConvertPdfTables (class)

**Code:**
```python
class TestConvertPdfTables(unittest.TestCase):
    pass

    # Not using tables at the moment
    #
    # def test_empty_pdf(self):
    #
    #     self.assertEqual(0, len(convert_pdf_to_instruments(pdf_empty_table)))
    #
    # def test_two_questions(self):
    #     self.assertEqual(2, len(convert_pdf_to_instruments(pdf_non_empty_table)[0].questions))
```

**Explanation:**
This class, `TestConvertPdfTables`, is a unit test case written in Python using the `unittest` framework. It's designed to test the functionality of a function called `convert_pdf_to_instruments`, which is expected to convert PDF tables into a specific data structure.

However, the class is currently empty and not being used, as indicated by the comment `# Not using tables at the moment`. The two test methods, `test_empty_pdf` and `test_two_questions`, are commented out and not being executed.

In simple terms, this class is a placeholder for future testing of PDF table conversion functionality, but it's not currently being utilized.
