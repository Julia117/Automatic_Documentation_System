# test_responses_gad_7 (function)

**Code:**
```python
def test_responses_gad_7(self):
        match = match_instruments([self.gad_7_english])
        sim = match.response_options_similarity

        # check dimensions
        n, m = sim.shape
        self.assertEqual(n, m)
        self.assertEqual(n, (len(self.gad_7_english.questions)))
        self.assertEqual(m, (len(self.gad_7_english.questions)))

        # check between 0 and 1
        self.assertTrue(np.all(0 <= sim))
        self.assertTrue(np.all(sim <= 1))

        # assert that the similarity matrix has 1s on its diagonals
        self.assertTrue(np.allclose(np.diag(sim), 1.))
        # assert that the similarity matrix is symmetric
        self.assertTrue(np.allclose(sim, sim.T))
        # assert that the similarity matrix is not empty
        self.assertTrue(sim.size > 0)
```

**Explanation:**
This function, `test_responses_gad_7`, is a unit test that checks the similarity matrix generated by the `match_instruments` function when it is given a single instrument, `self.gad_7_english`. 

Here's a simplified explanation:

1. It calls `match_instruments` with `self.gad_7_english` as input and stores the result in `match`.
2. It extracts the similarity matrix from `match` and stores it in `sim`.
3. It checks the dimensions of the similarity matrix:
   - It ensures that the matrix is square (i.e., its number of rows equals its number of columns).
   - It checks that the number of rows (or columns) equals the number of questions in the instrument.
4. It checks the values in the similarity matrix:
   - It ensures that all values are between 0 and 1.
   - It checks that the diagonal elements of the matrix are all 1s (i.e., the similarity of each question with itself is 1).
   - It checks that the matrix is symmetric (i.e., the similarity of question A with question B is the same as the similarity of question B with question A).
   - It checks that the matrix is not empty.

In essence, this function is verifying that the similarity matrix generated by `match_instruments` has the correct dimensions and values when given a single instrument.
